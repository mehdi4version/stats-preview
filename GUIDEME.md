## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

1- What HTML tags I have used to target the paragraphs and word for styling? 

I have tried to wrap the given text in specific elements and then target those elements. Following is the main example.


```html
<h1>Get <span>insights</span> that help your business grow. </h1>

```

2- How to make icon for my website. 

The following line of code can make an icon from my website. 

```html
 <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

1- I need to learn more about flex and grids in CSS. 

2- I need to learn media querries and how to make a mobile version of this website optimal for any device's screen size.
